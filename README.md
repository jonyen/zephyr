# Zephyr

A minimalistic ESV Bible reader for macOS.

Zephyr is a native Mac app built with SwiftUI that puts Scripture front and center — no accounts, no ads, no distractions. Just the Word.

## Why Zephyr?

Most Bible apps try to do everything — social features, devotional plans, video content, push notifications. I just wanted to read Scripture. No clutter, no accounts, no internet required.

I couldn't find a native macOS Bible reader that felt like it belonged on the Mac — lightweight, fast, and focused. So I built one. Zephyr is the app I wanted for my own daily reading: open it, read, close it. Nothing else getting in the way.

The name comes from the Greek word for a gentle breeze — that's exactly how reading Scripture should feel.

Zephyr will always be free. If you find it useful, consider [sponsoring the project on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/jonyen).
